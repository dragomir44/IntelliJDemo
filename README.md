# PercentageClock
As a Java project for myself I programmed a desktop application.
This desktop application is something I wanted to build for a long time to increase my productivity.

Application:  
On top this application shows the current time of your timezone.  
In the middle you can set your working hours. 
Based on your working hours it will show how much time has already passed with a percentage.
Using this clock gives a super-fast glance if I'm happy with the work I've done so far or not.
It is also a great indicatior for when the working world stops working... so around 18:00.
Oh and on the side, it also can show your favourite quotes randomly.

I built this into a jar file.
